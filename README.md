# Ozone - The Docker Compose Project

>_The entreprise-grade health information system that augments OpenMRS 3._

This is the official Docker Compose project for the free and open-source software flavour of Ozone, aka **Ozone FOSS**.
This Docker Compose project makes it easy to start and run an Ozone FOSS server on the infrastructure of your choice.

:bulb: **Did you know?** There is a *pro* flavour of Ozone, aka **Ozone Pro**, that adds a number of entreprise features to Ozone FOSS.

## 1. Quick start
[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/ozone-his/ozone-docker)

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ozone-his/ozone-docker
$ cd ozone-docker
$ ./start-demo.sh
```
It may take some time to download and setup Ozone for the first time, so hang tight :hourglass_flowing_sand:

Then [start browsing](#2-browse-ozone) Ozone.
